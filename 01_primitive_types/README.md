# 01 Â· Primitive Types

Master Python's fundamental data types through focused **microâ€‘drills** that build muscle memory for variables, strings, and numbers. Each drill targets specific concepts from the course curriculum.

> **Learning Rule**: Type every solution from scratch. No copy-paste. If stuck for 5+ minutes, peek at hints, then re-implement from memory.
