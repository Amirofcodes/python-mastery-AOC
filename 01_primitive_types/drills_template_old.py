# 01_primitive_types - Micro-drills for Variables, Strings, Numbers, and Type Conversion
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this template to drills.py to start fresh practice
# 2. Complete each drill by typing the solution yourself to build muscle memory
# 3. Only use primitive types and basic operations from notes_1.md
# 4. No control flow (if/else, loops, etc.) unless the prompt specifically allows
# 5. Test each drill before moving to the next
#
# Notes: See notes_1.md for detailed explanations of all concepts

# ===== CORE DRILLS (All Required) =====

# Drill 1: Variables, F-strings
# Prompt: Create variables for city, country, and population (in millions).
# Print: "<city>, <country> has <population> million people." using an f-string.
# Core concept: Variables · F-strings
# TODO: Create three variables and use f-string formatting


# Drill 2: String methods, slicing, len(), upper()
# Prompt: Given quote = "Talk is cheap. Show me the code.",
# print its total number of characters and the last word in uppercase (using slicing).
# Core concept: String methods · Slicing · `len()` · `upper()`
# TODO: Use len() and string slicing with upper() method


# Drill 3: input(), type conversion, arithmetic
# Prompt: Ask the user for their birth year (as input).
# Calculate and print their age in months. (Assume current year is 2025.)
# Core concept: `input()` · Type conversion · Arithmetic
# TODO: Convert string input to int and do arithmetic


# Drill 4: String methods - strip(), replace(), len()
# Prompt: Given password = " P@ssw0rd! ",
# - Strip leading and trailing spaces.
# - Replace '@' with 'a'.
# - Print the cleaned password and its length.
# Core concept: String methods · `strip()` · `replace()`
# TODO: Chain string methods and print results


# Drill 5: Numbers - round(), int() casting
# Prompt: Given pi = 3.14159,
# - Print pi rounded to 2 decimal places (multiple ways allowed).
# - Print pi converted to an integer.
# Core concept: Numbers · `round()` · `int()` casting
# TODO: Use round() function and int() conversion


# Drill 6: Escape sequences
# Prompt: Create a string that spans three lines using \n escape sequences.
# Print the string.
# Core concept: Escape sequences
# TODO: Use \n to create multi-line string


# Drill 7: Multiple assignment, variable names
# Prompt: Initialize a = 10 and b = 5.
# Swap their values using multiple assignment (no temp variable).
# Print both variables after swapping.
# Core concept: Multiple assignment · Variable names
# TODO: Use tuple unpacking to swap values


# Drill 8: String slicing, rfind() method
# Prompt: Ask the user to input a file path (e.g., "picture.png").
# Use rfind() and slicing to extract and print the file extension.
# Core concept: String slicing · `rfind()` method
# TODO: Use rfind() to locate last dot, then slice from there


# Drill 9: Numbers - ** operator, arithmetic
# Prompt: Calculate compound interest: P=100, r=0.04, n=5.
# Use the formula: A = P * (1 + r) ** n.
# Print the final result rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Core concept: Working with numbers · `**` operator
# TODO: Implement compound interest formula with exponentiation


# Drill 10: Boolean operators, string membership
# Prompt: Ask the user for an email address.
# Check if it contains both "@" and "." (using boolean operators).
# Print whether it's "Valid" or "Invalid".
# Core concept: Boolean operators · String membership
# TODO: Use 'in' operator with 'and' to check both conditions


# Drill 11: Variable naming conventions
# Prompt: Create and print variables using both snake_case and camelCase naming styles.
# Note which style is preferred in Python (comment in your code).
# Core concept: Variable names · Python conventions
# TODO: Create variables with different naming styles and comment on Python preference


# Drill 12: Formatted strings, number formatting
# Prompt: Format 1234567.89 with thousands separators and 2 decimal places using an f-string.
# Print the formatted result.
# Core concept: Formatted strings · Number formatting
# TODO: Use f-string with formatting specifications


# Drill 13: String methods - find(), slicing
# Prompt: Given full_name = "John Doe",
# - Use find() and slicing to extract the first and last name (no split()).
# - Print them separately.
# Core concept: String methods · `find()` · Slicing
# TODO: Use find() to locate space, then slice before and after


# Drill 14: Type conversion, arithmetic, f-strings
# Prompt: Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius (float input).
# Convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula F = C × 9/5 + 32.
# Print the result to 1 decimal place using an f-string.
# Core concept: Type conversion · Arithmetic · F-strings
# TODO: Convert input to float, apply formula, format output


# Drill 15: Multi-line strings, string methods
# Prompt: Create a multi-line string using triple quotes.
# Count and print the total number of words (use split() and len()).
# Also print the original multi-line string.
# Core concept: Multi-line strings · String methods
# TODO: Use triple quotes and split() method to count words
