# 02_control_flow - Micro-drills for Conditionals, Loops, and Logical Operators
#
# Instructions: Complete each drill by typing the solution yourself.
# Build on primitive types concepts only - no functions or advanced structures yet.

# ===== DRILLS TO COMPLETE (1-13) =====

# Drill 1: Comparison operators, conditional statements, chaining
# Prompt: Ask user's age, print Teen/Adult/Senior using if/elif/else with chained comparison (13 <= age <= 19)

# Drill 2: Ternary operator
# Prompt: One-liner: parity = "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd" then print it

# Drill 3: Logical operators, short-circuit evaluation
# Prompt: Safely divide two numbers; if divisor is 0, use 'and' short-circuit to skip; print result or "undefined"

# Drill 4: for loop, break, for-else
# Prompt: Loop 5× asking for password. break on correct entry; for-else prints "Locked out" if never correct

# Drill 5: Nested loops, range() function
# Prompt: Print 5×5 multiplication table (each row one line) using nested for loops with range()

# Drill 6: for-else, comparisons, break
# Prompt: From numbers 7, 2, 9, 4, 0 find first value ≥ 8. Use break; for-else prints "No match" if not found

# Drill 7: while loop, infinite loops, break
# Prompt: Build while True number-guessing game (1-10). Count attempts; break on success; print win message

# Drill 8: Iterables, string iteration, membership
# Prompt: Prompt for text and count vowels using for char in text: loop with membership testing

# Drill 9: Conditional statements, multiple assignment
# Prompt: a = 3, b = 8 — swap them only if b is larger using conditional logic

# Drill 10: while loop, conditional logic, arithmetic
# Prompt: Print first 10 terms of Collatz sequence: if even divide by 2, if odd multiply by 3 and add 1

# Drill 11: Chained comparison, ternary operator
# Prompt: Ask for temperature, print "Comfy" if 20 <= temp <= 26, else "Too hot" or "Too cold" using ternary

# Drill 12: Logical operators, modulus, XOR logic
# Prompt: Loop 1..100, print numbers divisible by 3 or 5 but not both (XOR logic) using modulus

# Drill 13: for-else, reverse range
# Prompt: Use range(10, -1, -1) for countdown; after loop, print "Blast off!" via for-else
