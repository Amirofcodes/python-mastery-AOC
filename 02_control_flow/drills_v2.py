# Rules
# - Type every solution yourself
# - Only use concepts from Primitive Types + these notes (no lists/dicts yet)
# - Keep outputs small and readable

# Drill 1: Age category
# Create a program that asks for age and prints Child (<13), Teen (13‑17), or Adult (18+).


# Drill 2: Parity (ternary)
# Create a program that asks for an integer and prints "even" or "odd" using a one‑line ternary.


# Drill 3: Safe divide with short‑circuit
# Ask for 2 numbers. If the second is 0, print "undefined". Otherwise print the division result.


# Drill 4: Password attempts (for + break + for‑else)
# Ask up to 5 times for a password. If correct, print "Access granted" and stop.
# If never correct, print "Locked out" (use for‑else).


# Drill 5: Multiplication table (nested for)
# Print a 5×5 table (each row on one line). Values are i*j for 1..5.


# Drill 6: First match with for‑else
# From 7, 2, 9, 4, 0 find the first value >= 8. Print it, else print "No match".


# Drill 7: Countdown with for‑else
# Use range to count down 10..0. After loop completes, print "Blast off!" using for‑else.


# Drill 8: Vowel counter (membership)
# Ask for text and print how many vowels it contains (a, e, i, o, u). Case‑insensitive.


# Drill 9: Menu loop (while True)
# Show: 1) Hello 2) Bye 3) Quit. Print the corresponding word or quit on 3.


# Drill 10: Range guards with logical operators
# Ask for a number 1..10. If out of range, print "Out of range"; else print "OK".


# Drill 11: Temperature comfort (chained comparisons)
# Ask for temperature and print "Comfy" if 20 <= t <= 26 else "Not comfy".


# Drill 12: Collatz 10 steps (while)
# Ask for a positive integer n and print 10 steps of Collatz rules (even: n//=2, odd: n=3n+1).


# Drill 13: XOR logic (3 or 5 but not both)
# Loop 1..100 and print numbers divisible by 3 or 5 but not both.
