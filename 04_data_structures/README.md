# 04 · Data Structures

Master Python's core collections through **comprehensive understanding** of lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Learn ALL the different ways to create, access, manipulate, and combine these fundamental data structures.

> Learning Rule: Build only on previous sections (primitive types, control flow, functions). Focus on foundational mastery before advanced features.

## 2 · Mini‑Projects (Data Mastery Focus)

Apply your comprehensive data structure knowledge to practical problems.

### A. Contact Manager (All Structures) — 40 min

**Goal:** Build an in-memory contact management system using all data structures.

- **Data Model:** Contacts as dicts, stored in list, with sets for tags, tuples for addresses
- **Features:** Add/edit/delete contacts, search by name/email, filter by tags
- **Focus:** Choosing optimal structure for each feature, performance considerations
- **Structures Used:** Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples in combination

### B. Text Analysis Tool (Sets + Dicts) — 35 min

**Goal:** Analyze text for word frequency, unique words, and patterns.

- **Features:** Word count, unique word identification, most/least common words
- **Data Handling:** Sets for uniqueness, dictionaries for counting, sorting by frequency
- **Focus:** Performance comparison (list vs set membership testing)
- **Structures Used:** Sets for fast membership, dictionaries for counting

### C. Grade Book System (Nested Structures) — 30 min

**Goal:** Manage student grades using nested data structures.

- **Data Model:** Students dict → courses list → assignments dict → grades list
- **Features:** Add grades, calculate averages, find top performers, grade distribution
- **Focus:** Complex data structure combinations, tuple unpacking for calculations
- **Structures Used:** All structures in nested combinations

## 4 · Integration with Next Section

**Next:** Section 05 (Exceptions) will teach you to make your data operations robust by handling errors gracefully. You'll add try/except blocks around data operations and validate inputs safely.

**Connection:** The error handling patterns you learn will directly apply to the KeyError, ValueError, and IndexError exceptions common in data structure operations.
