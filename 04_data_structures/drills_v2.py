# 04_data_structures · Micro‑drills (Beginner Edition)
# Use only concepts from previous sections plus these data structures.

# Drill 1: Lists
# Create letters = ["a", "b", "c"]. Print length, first, last.


# Drill 2: Indexing + slicing
# Given nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], print second item and last two items.


# Drill 3: Unpacking
# Unpack [3, 7, 9] into x, y, z and print them.


# Drill 4: enumerate
# For names = ["Ana", "Ben", "Cleo"], print "<index>: <name>".


# Drill 5: Add/Remove
# Start with ["a", "b", "c"]; append("d"), insert(0, "-"), pop(0), remove("b"); print.


# Drill 6: Membership + search
# values = [5, 42, 7, 42]; print first index of 42 if present else "Not found".


# Drill 7: Sorting basics
# Sort [75, 92, 88, 69] ascending then descending; print both.


# Drill 8: Sort with key (lambda)
# Sort students = [("Ana", 3.7), ("Ben", 3.9), ("Cleo", 3.5)] by GPA; print result.


# Drill 9: map()
# Convert prices_eur = [10, 20, 30] to USD at 1.1; build list and print.


# Drill 10: filter()
# Keep only even numbers from 1..20; build list and print.


# Drill 11: list comprehensions
# Rewrite 9 and 10 using comprehensions; print both lists.


# Drill 12: zip()
# Pair ids = [1,2,3] with names = ["A","B","C"] into list of tuples; print.


# Drill 13: Stack with list
# Implement push, pop, peek on a list and demonstrate 3 operations.


# Drill 14: Queue with deque
# Use collections.deque to enqueue three items and dequeue two; print remaining.


# Drill 15: Tuples and immutability
# Create color = (255,160,64), unpack r,g,b. Try modifying (comment) and print r,g,b.


# Drill 16: Swapping variables
# Swap a = 10 and b = 20 using tuple unpacking; print before/after.


# Drill 17: Arrays (typed)
# from array import array; arr = array('i', [1,2,3]); append 4; (comment: appending 2.5 raises TypeError); print arr.


# Drill 18: Sets - uniqueness
# From text = "a b c a b d", build a set of unique words; print size and membership of "c" and "z".


# Drill 19: Dictionaries
# person = {"name":"Ada","age":35}; update age to 36; print keys and values.


# Drill 20: Dict comprehension
# words = ["apple","banana","pear"]; build {w: len(w)}; print it.


# Drill 21: Generator expression
# Compute sum of squares 1..10 without building a list; print result.


# Drill 22: Unpacking operators * and **
# Merge [1,2] and [3,4] with * into a new list; merge two dicts with **; print results.


# Drill 23: Mini exercise (mixed)
# Given transactions = [("+",30),("-",10),("+",5)], compute final balance starting at 0; print result.
