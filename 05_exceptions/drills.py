# 05_exceptions · Micro‑drills (Exception Handling)
# Use only concepts from previous sections plus exception handling.

# Drill 1: Basic try/except
# Ask for a number, convert with int(), handle ValueError if invalid input. Print result or error msg.


# Drill 2: Function error handling
# Create safe_divide(a, b) that handles ZeroDivisionError and returns result or error message.


# Drill 3: Multiple exceptions in loops
# Read a list of strings ["42", "hello", "3.14", "world"], convert each to int() with try/except. Print converted numbers and error count.


# Drill 4: Complete exception flow
# Use try/except/else/finally to open a file "test.txt", read content, and ensure it's always closed.


# Drill 5: Raising custom exceptions
# Create validate_age(age) that raises ValueError if age < 0 or age > 150. Test with valid/invalid ages.


# Drill 6: Multiple specific exceptions
# Handle multiple exception types: ValueError, TypeError, KeyError in a single try block. Test each type.


# Drill 7: Context managers
# Use 'with open()' to read a file safely. Compare with manual file handling using try/finally.
